# EducationalBattle

This is my second completed game, I made this for my exam for school called "Game Development". I had to create a game all by myself for a made up company called "best education."

## Whats the game?

This game is a bullet hell/boss fight game where you are trying to defeat a fallen angel.

## Features

My game had some Backlogs I had to have and implemented into my game:

- play the game
- control a character
- winning/losing condition
- restarting the game
- a logo, name and slogan of "best education"
- a score

## How to play in unity?

-download all the files and put them all in one folder
-have the correct version of unity installed and working (I used Unity 2020.3.26f1)
-create a new project
-in your project, click on assets->import assets->custom assets
-click on the folder where all the files are in
-once it's all loaded, press on the scene called "Complete game"
then play
